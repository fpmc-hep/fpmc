 * Added EFT for AA->AZ, according to Sylvain and Gero's computations. Datacard: dataQED_AZanom
 * In 2017-02-15 corrected the ME to include two operators which induce the Zgamma process.

2016-09-23 Cristian Baldenegro <c.baldenegro@cern.ch / crisx.baldenegro@gmail.com>

 * Correction for AA->Spin2->AA (-1 factor when calling Mxxxx matrix elements)
 * Couldn't run dataQED_ZZanom anymore; now it's corrected.

2016-06-20 Cristian Baldenegro <c.baldenegro@cern.ch / crisx.baldenegro@gmail.com>

 * Exclusive AA-> HH (IPROC=16071) and AA->Dijet (IPROC=16070) were included
 * Matrix elements calculated by Gero von Gersdorff and Sylvain Fichet
 * Correspond to Datacards:  dataQED_HHexoticSPin0EvenResonances and dataQED_GluGluexoticSpin0EvenResonances respectively
 * New parameters (F0H and F0G)

2016-05-20 Cristian Baldenegro <c.baldenegro@cern.ch / crisx.baldenegro@gmail.com>

 * Exclusive AA->ZZ (IPROC=16066) and AA->AZ (IPROC=16068)
 * Exclusive AA->WW (IPROC=16067) and AA->AA (IPROC=16069) processes included
 * Helicity amplitudes from Gero von Gersdorff and Sylvain Fichet
 * Corresponding datacards: dataQED_ZZexoticSpin0EvenResonances and dataQED_AZexoticSpin0EvenResonances
dataQED_WWexoticSpin0EvenResonances and dataQED_AAexoticSpin2Resonances
 * New parameter F0Z (1/coupling for Phi->ZZ) AF0ZG (1/coupling for Phi->gamma Z)
 * New parameter F0W (1/coupling for phi->WW)
 * Such exclusive productions are included in the same subroutine calling section as Matthias' (AAANOM=3, AAEXOTIC=1)

2015-07-24 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * IMPORTANT BUG CORRECTIONS: symmetry factor was omitted for
  gamgam->gamgam, now added. As a result, gamgam->gamgam xsec twice smaller

2015-06-25 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * exclusive gamma gamma->gamma gamma studies, exotic spin 0-even resonance added
  * IPROC=16065, associated datacard, dataQED_AAexoticSpin0EvenResonances
  * new parameters AAF0 (1/coupling), AAW (width const), AAA2 (dumping factor
  for sqrt(s) dependence of the width)

2015-01-20 Christophe Royon <christophe.royon@cern.ch>, Murilo Rangel <murilo.rangel@cern.ch>
  * correct for normalisation for reggeon (applied in PDFs and not in flux)

2014-11-26 Christophe Royon <christophe.royon@cern.ch>
  * new code for heavy ion flux (nflux=11)
  * new cards to transmit BMIN
  * new code and fluxes for proton ion, ion proton via Pom/Photon exchange
  * bug fix for photon pom

2014-09-11 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Fix for gamma gamma->gamma gamma, high energy limit implemented (sqrt(s)>>m)
  * Final release for gamma gamma->gamma gamma :)

2014-08-18 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Anomalous aaaa with compHEP routine found to be wrong (around a factor 2.1
  too small)
  * Code from Gero and Sylvain replaced the compHEP routine, everything is now
  in agreement
  * Possibility to switch back to compHEP routine by commenting/uncommenting
  fpmc.f l. 3435
  * The new EFT routine takes interferences with SM aa production via W loop
  into account

2014-03-20 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * General update/upgrade of the QED Diphoton exclusive process
  * IPROC=16060, SM QED Exc diphoton production (W + massive fermions loops included)
  * (old routine is IPROC=19800 kept for comparison purpose but is most likely
  to be WRONG)
  * IPROC=16061, SM QED Exc diphoton production at high mass (massive fermion
  loops EXCLUDED)
  * IPROC=16062, SM QED  Exc diphoton production at low mass (W loop EXCLUDED)
  * IPROC=16063, General exotic vector contributions with SM interf (SM fermion
   loops EXCLUDED
  * IPROC=16064, General exotic fermion contributions with SM interf (SM
  fermion EXCLUDED)
  * Corresponding datacards added

2014-01-21 Christophe Royon <christophe.royon@cea.fr>
  * with Goergiy Stelmakh,
  * add Reggeon (nflux=10), Pomeron-Reggeon (nflux=19), Reggeon Pomeron (nflux=21)
  * Photon-Pomeron (nflux=20), Pomeron-Photon (nflux=22)

2013-12-12 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Adding aa->aa anomalous couplings (IPROC=16016) based on arXiv:1311.6815 [hep-ph]
  * Adding ~/External/comphep_interface/sqme_aaaa folder
  * Modifications of ~/Examples/ffcard., module., module_reco., fpmc_main. and  ~/Fpmc/fpmc.

2013-03-26 Oldrich Kepka <oldrich.kepka@cern.ch>
  * Adding setup_lxplus.sh, to be used on lxplus to configure CERNLIB

2012-06-05 Rafal Staszewski
  * New Examples/fpmc_main.f created to supercede module.f and module_reco.f.
  module and module_reco are disabled in the Makefile. The new exacutable is
  called fpmc.
  * The information from jet alg. was not stored into ntuple. A change in
  External/ntuple.f was needed to fix it.
  * New OUTPUT option added to steering, determining the generator output.
  Possible values:
    0 : Only the text output with the cross section at the end.
    1 : Ntuple with few histograms and a list of particles for each event.
    2 : Jet CONE algorithm is performed and its output is also stored in the
    ntuple.

2011-05-09  Oldrich Kepka  <oldrich.kepka@cern.ch>
  * Tagging version fpmc_v01-05 - cleanup of nutples, version for testing
