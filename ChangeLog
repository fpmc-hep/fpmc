  * Tagging version fpmc_v01-05 - cleanup of nutples, version for testing 

2012-06-05 Rafal Staszewski
  * New Examples/fpmc_main.f created to supercede module.f and module_reco.f.
  module and module_reco are disabled in the Makefile. The new exacutable is
  called fpmc.
  * The information from jet alg. was not stored into ntuple. A change in
  External/ntuple.f was needed to fix it.
  * New OUTPUT option added to steering, determining the generator output.
  Possible values:
    0 : Only the text output with the cross section at the end.
    1 : Ntuple with few histograms and a list of particles for each event.
    2 : Jet CONE algorithm is performed and its output is also stored in the
    ntuple.
