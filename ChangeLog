* new code for heavy ion flux (nflux=11) 
* new cards to transmit BMIN
* new code and fluxes for proton ion, ion proton via Pom/Photon exchange 
* bug fix for photon pom

2014-09-11 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Fix for gg->gg, high energy limit implemented (sqrt(s)>>m)
  * Final release for gg->gg :)

2014-08-18 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Anomalous aaaa with compHEP routine found to be wrong (around a factor 2.1
  too small)
  * Code from Gero and Sylvain replaced the compHEP routine, everything is now
  in agreement
  * Possibility to switch back to compHEP routine by commenting/uncommenting
  fpmc.f l. 3435
  * The new EFT routine takes interferences with SM aa production via W loop
  into account

2014-03-20 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * General update/upgrade of the QED Diphoton exclusive process
  * IPROC=16060, SM QED Exc diphoton production (W + massive fermions loops included)
  * (old routine is IPROC=19800 kept for comparison purpose but is most likely
  to be WRONG)
  * IPROC=16061, SM QED Exc diphoton production at high mass (massive fermion
  loops EXCLUDED)
  * IPROC=16062, SM QED  Exc diphoton production at low mass (W loop EXCLUDED)
  * IPROC=16063, General exotic vector contributions with SM interf (SM fermion
   loops EXCLUDED
  * IPROC=16064, General exotic fermion contributions with SM interf (SM
  fermion EXCLUDED)
  * Corresponding datacards added

2014-01-21 Christophe Royon <christophe.royon@cea.fr>
  * with Goergiy Stelmakh,
  * add Reggeon (nflux=10), Pomeron-Reggeon (nflux=19), Reggeon Pomeron (nflux=21)
  * Photon-Pomeron (nflux=20), Pomeron-Photon (nflux=22)

2013-12-12 Matthias Saimpert <matthias.saimpert@cern.ch>
  * Adding aa->aa anomalous couplings (IPROC=16016) based on arXiv:1311.6815 [hep-ph]
  * Adding ~/External/comphep_interface/sqme_aaaa folder
  * Modifications of ~/Examples/ffcard., module., module_reco., fpmc_main. and  ~/Fpmc/fpmc.

2013-03-26 Oldrich Kepka <oldrich.kepka@cern.ch>
  * Adding setup_lxplus.sh, to be used on lxplus to configure CERNLIB

2012-06-05 Rafal Staszewski
  * New Examples/fpmc_main.f created to supercede module.f and module_reco.f.
  module and module_reco are disabled in the Makefile. The new exacutable is
  called fpmc.
  * The information from jet alg. was not stored into ntuple. A change in
  External/ntuple.f was needed to fix it.
  * New OUTPUT option added to steering, determining the generator output.
  Possible values:
    0 : Only the text output with the cross section at the end.
    1 : Ntuple with few histograms and a list of particles for each event.
    2 : Jet CONE algorithm is performed and its output is also stored in the
    ntuple.

2011-05-09  Oldrich Kepka  <oldrich.kepka@cern.ch>
  * Tagging version fpmc_v01-05 - cleanup of nutples, version for testing
